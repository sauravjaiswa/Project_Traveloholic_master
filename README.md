# Traveloholic_master
 An android application for travellers and tourists which will help them travel any place independently.

<h1>TRAVELOHOLIC</h1>
The purpose of the android tourist guide is to ease the traveller’s lifestyle. It would help them become independent as they would not require the help of a third person in planning their trip’s itinerary. The application would help the tourists to keep a check whether they have visited all the nearby places and have not missed any place. It would help in saving some valuable time of the tourists by recommending them the best paths to travel to a particular location. The application also has a feature which helps people become a guide, helps people hiring a guide by seeing the list of guides, saving emergency contact numbers and group chat feature.

It is said, that travelling helps in relaxing a person’s mind and helps him to isolate himself from daily tensed life and rush. This is probably the reason most of the people prefer to go out for excursions and trips on their vacations. There is no doubt that Google Maps has been the helping hand for such travellers who are visiting any place for the first time. But still there are other major barriers for the travellers such as language, they have to depend on others for solving any of their doubts, they have to hire a local guide at a very high rate and they can also get stuck anywhere due to bad weather as they forgot checking the weather of that location before visiting. Hence, with the help of this project, I hope to ease out and remove all such barriers of the tourists and travellers. These all features collectively becomes an integral part of a trip and would help us travel without any hindrances or barrier of language and without depending on a third person. I hope that the travellers and tourists will use this application since it would not only make their work easier but also prove to be cost effective for them. Not only would it be beneficial for the travellers, but also for those who want to become a guide and earn money.
